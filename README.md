ABOUT THE GAME:

In Super Peach Sisters, Peach starts out a new game with three lives and continues to play until all of her lives have been exhausted. There are multiple levels in Super Peach Sisters, beginning with level 1, and during each level except for the last Peach must reach a flag to continue to the next level. On the last level, Peach must reach (and thus save) Mario in order to win the entire game (there is no flag on the last level).Peach may move left or right, and may also jump. Because of the strange physics of the Mushroom Queendom, Peach can actually move left and right while jumping in the air as well, which makes it easier for her to jump from platform to platform.

There are three different types of goodies: star goodies, mushroom goodies and flower goodies. Star goodies give Peach invincibility for a limited amount of time, so she canâ€™t be injured by coming into contact with enemies like koopas, goombas, piranhas, or piranha fireballs. Mushroom goodies give Peach the ability to jump extra high, allowing her to reach platforms that would otherwise be out of reach. Finally, flower goodies enable Peach to shoot fireballs to destroy her enemies. Enjoy!
